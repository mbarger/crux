		 <h3>Ben Franklin and his Dynamic Book Collection</h3>
	     <blockquote>The story of John Bunyan, Nathaniel Crouch, and what their books meant to Franklin reveals an important aspect of his library.  At any given moment the books shelved within it mirrored his personality.  Once he could no longer identify with the ideas "Pilgrim's Progress" represented, he neither needed nor wanted the book in his library.  Instead, he turned it and his other Bunyan volumes into capital, which he used to acquire new books more closely reflecting his state of mind.  He would often repeat the process.  His library was a dynamic collection.  Once he exhausted a book's usefulness, he sometimes got rid of it.  If he thought someone else might benefit from one of his books, he might give it to that person.  Not until the end of his life, when he started thinking about the permanence of his library, did he hesitate to remove books from his collection.</blockquote>
